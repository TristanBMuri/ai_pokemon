# AI with Reinforcement Learning for Nuzlock Pokemon Radical Red 4.1

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an AI that can play Pokemon Radical Red 4.1 using Reinforcement Learning techniques. The Nuzlocke challenge adds an extra layer of difficulty by requiring players to catch the first Pokemon they encounter, and only one Pokemon per party.

## Objectives
- Implement a reinforcement learning agent that can play Pokemon Radical Red
- Apply Nuzlocke rules to the AI's gameplay
- Develop a system to train and evaluate the AI's performance
- Create a framework for continuous improvement of the AI

## Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenAI Gym
- Pokemon ROM hacking tools
- Reinforcement Learning libraries

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Source code for the AI agent and training scripts
- `data/` - Training data and model checkpoints
- `docs/` - Documentation and reports
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the training script
4. Evaluate the trained model
